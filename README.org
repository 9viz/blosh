#+TITLE: blosh
[[https://github.com/diamondburned/disblob][disblob]] but in sh !!! Because using Go for scripting is overkill !!!!!!

#+begin_src sh
$ time ./blosh >css.css
    0m14.93s real     0m05.98s user     0m09.55s system
#+end_src

Rewrite of https://github.com/ThatGeekyWeeb/blobash

~blosh~ does not include actual Unicode characters in the CSS because I
don't know how to go from Unicode code point to actual character in
pure sh.
